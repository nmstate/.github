# nmstate-console-plugin-proposal

Proposal to add [nmstate-console-plugin](https://github.com/upalatucci/nmstate-console-plugin) as a repo under the `nmstate` org namespace

`nmstate-console-plugin` is an openshift web console plugin. 
It will be used to list, create, delete and manage nmstate resources using the console UI.

NOTE: openshift web console can be installed also in k8s clusters.

- [x] CI enabled and passed.
- [x] Has integration test cases proving valid use cases. (For now just one react test but we can discuss about how to create also e2e tests)
- [x] Licensed under LGPL-2.0+ or Apache-2.0+(preferred).
